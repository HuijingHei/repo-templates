# This workflow is specifically for repos that maintain a versioned Docker
# tag per Git tag, plus a 'release' tag that's aliased to the latest
# versioned tag.  If there's a security update for the container base image,
# we need to be able to update 'release' and create a new versioned tag
# (e.g. 'v1.2.3-1') without creating a corresponding Git tag.
#
# Don't list repos that solely ship the main branch, since those can force a
# rebuild by just pushing a commit.
